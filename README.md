## Known Issues

- Upon my (last minute) discovery that Charts.js doesn't actually have a candlestick, I downloaded and fought with the candlestick extension. I decided to switch to ECharts just for the one graph, so it's kinda wonky right now. If I had more time, I'd switch the rest of the charts over for unification's sake. After using both, ECharts has sold me.
- The single-file mass of 500 lines of code terrifies me, there's got to be a better way. I should probably encapsulate more groups of functions into objects, but alas, it's 11PM right now.
- Resizing the window in the chart view is no bueno.
- Sorting the stock data could be better, with little arrows indicating what you're sorting by.
